The sprite characters will be options for a mobile learning app coach, who provides context information and answers questions inside of a learning system.</p>\n<p>An example of an earlier character model (in the 3D animation version) is PAL3, with an example here:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiUT1gfPm3k&#x26;t=30s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiUT1gfPm3k&#x26;t=30s</a></p>\n<p>The new characters will form a similar functional role, but with the intention to increase our ability to allow character selection and customizing the character models to different content-specific releases of the core mobile app framework (e.g., leadership content, suicide prevention content, computer science content).
