HaRVI Lab is seeking a MS or UG students to work on a haptic texture modeling project. The overall goal is to explore the transformation from the graphic texture modeling to the haptic texture modeling. Successful candidate will collaborate with a PhD student on the project.

## The candidates are expected to:
* Create graphic texture models in one of computer graphic modeling software (Blender, Maya or others)
* Integrate the graphic texture models into the haptic texture modeling and rendering pipeline
* Learn and understand the basic haptic texture modeling methods
* Test the haptic texture models through 3D haptic devices and gain hands-on experience

## Key Qualifications:
* Proficiency in one of computer graphic modeling software (Blender, Maya or others)
* Familiarity with texture modeling in the one of above software
* Proficiency in OpenGL
* Proficiency writing and maintaining code in C++

## Helpful Qualifications:
* Data processing experience
* Basic knowledge of haptic texture modeling and rendering
 
We would like the candidates to dedicate at least 4 hours on the project every week, and participate in the project for at least two semesters. Interested students should send their resume, unofficial transcript, and a brief introduction paragraph to Shihan Lu <shihanlu@usc.edu> who will review the top candidates with Prof. Culbertson. Initially, the position will be on a volunteer basis or for Directed Research Credits.
