The USC Institute for Creative Technologies Learning Science group is seeking a student worker for the Spring 2022 semester who is interested and talented in creating animated sprite characters for a cross-platform mobile learning app. We have historically used 3D characters in Unity, but are developing our current app in React Native with the goal of lighter-weight sprite characters but still engaging. The sprite characters will be options for a mobile learning app coach, who provides context information and answers questions inside of a learning system.
 
An example of an earlier character model (in the 3D animation version) is PAL3, with an example here:

The new characters will form a similar functional role, but with the intention to increase our ability to allow character selection and customizing the character models to different content-specific releases of the core mobile app framework (e.g., leadership content, suicide prevention content, computer science content). Characters made during this position will be encouraged to include in portfolios and demo reels.
