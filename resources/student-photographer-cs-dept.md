USC's Department of Computer Science is seeking reliable and talented student photographers to showcase our amazing department! 
 
Responsibilities include photographing faculty members, students, campus life, and events. The photos will appear on USC websites, newsletters, social media, and more (our former student photographer's work was featured in the Washington Post). 
 
Applicants should have experience taking photos of people, ideally in a professional environment (headshots, etc). Project-based: hours may vary. Pay rate: $18 p/h.  
 
This is a great opportunity to expand your portfolio and meet interesting people. 

If interested, please email your resume, a portfolio of work samples, and whether you have access to a camera to Caitlin Dawson at dawsonc@usc.edu
