The USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) has several graduate student researcher positions open immediately. Currently, the ICT building is closed to observe social-distancing guidelines. The student researchers will work remotely with the rest of the team. In addition to the technical requirements, please note that 1. the successful candidate must be located in the US to work on these research projects, and 2.
