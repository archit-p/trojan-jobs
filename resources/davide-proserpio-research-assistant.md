I have two RA positions that I am looking for, can you share the following ads with students at Viterbi:
 
## Scraping Airbnb
I am looking for a research assistant that can scrape the Airbnb website (user profiles, listings profile, user and listing reviews). The ideal candidate should be familiar with scraping websites using Python. I addition, the ideal candidate should be familiar with managing large amount of data and MySQL to insert the data in a database.

## Implementing a bot that search and look for specific products on Amazon/Newegg/Barnes & Noble
The ideal candidate is familiar with Python/Selenium/JavaScript and scarping website. The bot should act like a customer searching for a product on the platforms mentioned above.
