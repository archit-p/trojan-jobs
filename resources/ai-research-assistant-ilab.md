The iLab at CS Department of USC is looking for two self-motivated MS/Junior PhD students to work on developing cutting-edge algorithms for Computer Vision, Machine learning, and Human-centric AI. The projects focus on challenging tasks such as visual reasoning, causal explainable AI, zero/few-shot learning, and continual learning. The goal is to publish top-tier conferences/journals such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, JMLR.

## Required Skills

* Familiar with Python-based deep learning frameworks (preferably PyTorch)
* Experience in Deep learning/machine learning for computer vision/Graph Neural Network/Causal inference/explainable AI tasks
* Good Mathematical, machine learning background, and coding skills.

## Desired Skills

* Targeting for pursuing Ph.D. degree after graduation.
* Practical knowledge about visual reasoning, causal explainable AI, zero/few-shot learning, continual learning

## What you will obtain

* Opportunity of publishing top-tier conferences/journals.
* Close working with Senior Ph.D. (https://gyhandy.github.io/) and Professor Laurent Itti (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xhUvqK8AAAAJ&hl=en).
* Reference letter based on your performance.

Interested applicants should contact yunhaoge@usc.edu. Applicants should attach a CV, roughly hours can contribute to project per week, and also highlight in the email your relevant experience. The subject line of the email has to include the phrase [ILab-RA] or otherwise may be discarded. Thanks for your attention!
