I am looking to hire a Masters student or senior undergraduate for 10-20 hours per week in the Spring 2022 semester to join an DHS-funded project on using AI for water infrastructure resilence planning. This project is in collaboration with the LA Department of Water and Power (LADWP). The student will work with large volumes of spatially explicit data of the water pipe system and the earthquake hazards across the region. The student will be responsible for improving our existing optimization tool with additional requirements, running experiments with different data and regions, generating end-user friendly documentation and packaging the tool for easy installation at end-user sites, interacting with practitioners to present results and elicit software specifications. The algorithms are large-scale network design problems solved with network-flow Integer Programming models, and dynamic programming. 

I am looking for a student highly proficient in Python, dealing with GIS data, and running experiments on a cluster. Ideally the candidate will also have experience in algorithms and optimization. Must have availability to contribute enough time to this fast moving project. 
 
Please send your CVs to dilkina@usc.edu and taoanhua@usc.edu.
