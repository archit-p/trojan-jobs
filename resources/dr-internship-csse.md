If you are a Master Student and need one or two units or want to enhance your resume, consider signing up for Directed Research with the Center for Systems and Software Engineering (CSSE), under Dr. Barry Boehm during the Spring 2022 semester (CSCI-590 Section 30162). This DR course will emphasize the practice and development of software engineering techniques while working on a product that is or will be available to users. Students will be chosen for a project based on skills and interest, to encourage the concept of treating these projects as relevant opportunities to enhance resumes and develop software engineering skills.

If you are not a CS student, you will need to receive approval from your advisor prior to accepting any offer letter in DR.

Please read carefully all instructions bellow.

## General information
You can take DR as a regular registered student (and obtain credits) or as an Unpaid Intern:

### Registered student:
* You can register for 1 credit or 2 credits in CS-590.
* Theexpectedamountofworkis5hours/weekpercredit.
* You will register for the course through USC Web Registration
(https://webreg.usc.edu/).
* D-Clearance is requested by CSSE.

### Unpaid intern:
* The expected amount of work is 20 hours/week.

DR is a pass/no pass course. Students are evaluated according to attendance, assignments, weekly and final project evaluations, participation, and conformance to projects’ documentation requirements.
This DR course offers a set of projects involving research and development. Projects are from start-ups developing applications or from Ph.D. students developing research projects. To take DR, you will participate in a recruitment process, where you can apply for vacancies in the projects you choose and receive offers from the projects’ responsible.
DR Recruitment: to see the opportunities and apply for vacancies, you can sign up in the DR portal at http://cssedr.usc.edu/dr_portal/.

### Signing up in the DR Portal
* Sign up in DR Portal (http://cssedr.usc.edu/dr_portal/):
    * Click on Student sign-up to register on our portal and fill the information required. After submitting your sign-up information, you will receive an e-mail with a link to activate your account.
    * Messages from the DR Portal may go to your junk email folder. You may add “no-reply@csssedr.usc.edu” as a contact to avoid that.
    * If you registered in previous semesters, you can just sign in and select the option “Enroll for Spring 2022”, which is below your student profile in your Home page.
* After activating your account, sign into the portal and fill out your information in the Survey page. The information you provide in this form will be viewed by potential clients to invite students to work in their projects.
    * You will select skills you have experience, as well as skills you would like to learn through this DR course.
    * You will also select the projects preference order (with 1 being most preferred).

### D-Clearance and Registering for DR (only for students that will register for credits):
You only need D-Clearance if you are taking DR for credits.

Your D-Clearance will be requested by CSSE to the department, based on the information you provided on the DR Portal (according to the number is units you selected). You do NOT need to ask for D-clearance through myViterbi for this section of DR.

After you sign up in the portal and fill the survey, allow at least 3 days to receive an e-mail from Julie Sanchez (jasanche@usc.edu) or Jincheng He (jinchenh@usc.edu ), notifying you that you have D-Clearance to register for DR.

After receiving the D-Clearance, please register through My USC, on Directed Research course, section 30162 (specific section for the Center for Systems and Software Engineering) with the exact number of units you requested (Do NOT register through My Viterbi).

If you have issues with registering due to a scheduling conflict, please contact the registrar’s office (onestop@usc.edu) with your student ID and the two conflicting sections. Let them know the directive research will not be meeting at that time unless you plan to join one of the projects directly offered through CSSE.
          
If you have any problem in registering in the course, you can e-mail Jincheng He (jinchenh@usc.edu ) or Julie Sanchez (JASanche@usc.edu).
If you need to request a change in units:
* If you change the number of units in the DR Portal after you received D-Clearance, you will have to wait and obtain a new D-Clearance before registering in the course through My USC.
    - After you receive a new D-Clearance, you will have to drop the course and re- register with the new number of units.

Please observe the deadlines for registration in the USC registration calendar.

## Unpaid Interns
If you are taking DR as an unpaid intern:
* You do not need to register through My USC or My Viterbi.
* If you are signing up for Optional Practical Training (OPT), you shouldn’t need any
extra documentation. OIS already knows about our internship program and you should only need to inform them you are working under us. Please note this is under the presumption you are a master’s student who has recently graduated.
